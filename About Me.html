    <p>
        There are many different event's in speech and debate, and there are several that I <br>
        have competed in. My best event is Original Oratory. This is a ten minute speech <br>
        that you write and memorize on a topic of your choice. <br>

    <p>
        I have been playing guitar for over five years. I originally learned on an acoustic <br>
        guitar, but I have since learned to play electric as well. <br>
